# AP-CSP-graphics-project

A visual scene developed as part of the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum. This project focuses on the fundamentals of 2D systems and object manipulation.

Technical Overview:
This project uses the CodeHS JavaScript Graphics Library to render shapes on a digital canvas. Key programming concepts visualised include:
.
Object repersentation: Creating new Rectangles class with specific dimensions.

Method Utilization: Using .setPosition(), .setColor(), and add() to modify object attributes and render them to the UI.

Coordinate Geometry: Precise placement of elements within a 400x500 grid system.

Future Goals:
This project served as my introduction to Object-Oriented Programming. I am currently transitioning from JavaScript to Java in preparation for CS2 KAP, where I will apply these logic foundations to more complex data structures and backend development.
